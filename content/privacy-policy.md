This Privacy Policy describes how Gospel Slides ("we," "us," or "our") handles your information when you use our website or services. Our commitment is to provide a privacy-first experience.

## 1. Information We Collect

Gospel Slides is designed to respect your privacy. We **do not use cookies or similar tracking technologies** to collect data on your device.

The only information we collect is standard **anonymous server log data**, which is automatically generated when you visit any website. This includes:

- **IP address:** A numerical label assigned to your device. This is used for security, troubleshooting, and general website operations, not for tracking individual users.
    
- **Operating System:** The software managing your device (e.g., Windows, macOS, Android, iOS).
    
- **Device Information:** General details about your device (e.g., desktop, mobile phone, tablet).
    
- **Usage Data:** Information about how our server responded to your requests, such as the pages accessed and the time of access.
    
- **Referral Source:** The website or link that directed you to Gospel Slides.

## 2. How We Collect and Use Information

We collect the anonymous server log data automatically for essential website operations, including:

- **To ensure security and prevent fraud:** Analyzing server logs helps us identify and prevent malicious activity.
    
- **To troubleshoot and maintain our services:** Logs are crucial for diagnosing technical issues and ensuring the smooth operation of Gospel Slides.
    
- **To analyze general website traffic:** We may look at aggregated, anonymous log data to understand overall usage patterns (e.g., how many visitors we had on a given day), but this data is not linked to individuals.
    

We **do not use Google Analytics or any other third-party analytics services** that would set cookies or track your activity across our site.

## 3. How We Share Your Information

We **do not share** the anonymous server log data we collect with any third parties, except when legally required (e.g., in response to a court order).

---

## 4. Cookies

**Gospel Slides does not use cookies** or any similar technologies (like local storage, web beacons, or pixel tags) on our website. You will not encounter a cookie consent banner because we do not set any cookies on your device.

---

## 5. Your Consent

Since we do not collect personal data and do not use cookies or tracking technologies, there is no specific consent mechanism required for these purposes. By simply accessing and using Gospel Slides, you acknowledge and agree to the collection of anonymous server log data as described in this policy.

---

## 6. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the anonymous server log data we collect. This data is retained only for as long as necessary for the purposes outlined above and is not used to identify individual users.

---

## 7. Your Rights

As we do not collect personal data that can identify you and do not use cookies, individual data rights such as access, correction, or deletion of specific personal data **do not apply** to the anonymous server log data we process.
