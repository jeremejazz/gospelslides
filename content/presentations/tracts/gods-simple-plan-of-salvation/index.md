## God's Simple Plan of Salvation

---


<b class="redtext">My Friend:</b> I am asking you the most important question of life.

{{< fragment >}}
**Your joy or sorrow for all eternity** depends on your **answer**.
{{< /fragment >}}

---

The question is:
{{< fragment >}}
<b>Are you saved?</b>
{{< /fragment >}}

---

It is not a question of how good you are,
nor if you are a church member, **but are you saved?** 

{{< fragment >}}
**Are you sure you will go to Heaven when you die?**
{{< /fragment >}}

---

God says in order to go to Heaven, you must be born again. In John 3:7, Jesus said to Nicodemus, <b class="redtext">"Ye must be born again."</b>

---

In the Bible God gives us the plan of how **be born again** which means **to be saved**. 

{{< fragment >}}
His plan is simple! You can be **saved** today. How?
{{< /fragment >}}

---


First, my friend, you must realize you are a sinner. 

{{< fragment >}}
<span class="redtext">"**For all have sinned,** and come short of the glory of God"</span> (Romans 3:23)
{{< /fragment >}}

---

Because you are sinner, you are condemned to death. 

{{< fragment >}}
<span class="redtext">"For the wages </span>(payment) <span class="redtext">of sin is death"</span> (Romans 6:23). 
{{< /fragment >}}

---
**This includes eternal separation from God in Hell.**

{{< fragment >}}
<span class="redtext">"... It is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment"</span> (Hebrews 9:27).
{{< /fragment >}}

---

But God loved you so much **He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus, to bear your sin and die in your place.** 

{{< fragment >}}
<span class="redtext">"...He hath made Him</span> *[Jesus, Who knew no sin]* <span class="redtext">to be sin for us...that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him"</span> (2 Corinthians 5:21).
{{< /fragment >}}

---

**Jesus had to shed His blood and die.** 

{{< fragment >}}
<span class="redtext">"For the life of the flesh is in the blood"</span> (Leviticus 17:11). 
{{< /fragment >}}
&nbsp;

{{< fragment >}}
<span class="redtext">"...without shedding of blood is no remission</span> *[pardon]*" (Hebrews 9:22)
{{< /fragment >}}

&nbsp;
{{< fragment >}}
<span class="redtext">"...God commandeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, **Christ died for us**"</span> (Romans 5:8).
{{< /fragment >}}


---

Although we cannot understand how, God said **my sins and your sins** were laid upon Jesus and **He died in our place**. He became **our substitute.** It is true, God cannot lie.

---

My friend, <span class="redtext">"God ... commandeth all men everywhere to **repent**"</span> (Acts 17:30). 

{{< fragment >}}
This **repentance** is a change of mind that agrees with God that one is a sinner, and also agrees with what Jesus did for us on the Cross.
{{< /fragment >}}

---

In Acts 16:30-31, the Philippian jailer asked Paul and Silas: 

{{< fragment >}}
<span class="redtext">"... Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" And they said, 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved...."</span>
{{< /fragment >}}

---

Simply believe on Him as **the one who bore your sin, died in your place,** was buried, and whom God resurrected. **His resurrection powerfully assures** that the believer can claim everlasting life when Jesus is received as Savior.

---

<span class="redtext">"But as many as received Him, **to them gave He power** to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name"</span> (John 1:12).

&nbsp;
{{< fragment >}}
<span class="redtext">"For **whosoever** shall call upon the name of the Lord **shall be saved**"</span> (Romans 10:13).
{{< /fragment >}}

&nbsp;
{{< fragment >}}
**Whosoever** includes you. **Shall be saved** means not maybe, nor can, **but shall be saved**.
{{< /fragment >}}

---

Surely, you realize you are a sinner. Right now, wherever you are, repenting, lift your heart to God in prayer.

---

{{< slide transition="slide-in fade-out" >}}

In Luke 18:13, the sinner prayed: 

<span class="redtext">"God be merciful to me a sinner."</span>

---
{{< slide transition="fade-in slide-out" >}}
Just pray: 

*"Oh God, I know I am a sinner, I believe Jesus was my substitute when he died on the Cross. I believe His shed blood, death, burial, and resurrection were for me, I now receive Him as my Savior. I thank You for the forgiveness of my sins, the gift of salvation and everlasting life, because of Your merciful grace. Amen."*


---

**Just take God at His word** and claim His salvation by faith. **Believe, and you will be saved.** No church, no lodge, no good works can save you. 

{{< fragment >}}
**Remember, God does the saving. All of it!**
{{< /fragment >}}

---

**God's simple plan of salvation is: You are a sinner.** Therefore, unless you believe on Jesus Who died in your place, you will spend eternity in Hell.

---

If you believe on Him as your crucified, buried, and risen Savior, you receive forgiveness for all of your sins and **His gift of eternal salvation by faith.**

---

You say, "Surely, it cannot be that simple." Yes, that simple! It is scriptural. It is God's plan. **My friend, believe on Jesus and receive Him as Savior today.**

---

If His plan is not perfectly clear, **read this tract over and over, without closing it until you understand it.** Your soul is worth more than all the world.


{{< fragment >}}
<span class="redtext">"For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, **and lose his own soul?**"</span> (Mark 8:36).
{{< /fragment >}}

---

Be sure you are saved. If you lose your soul, you miss Heaven and lose all. 

{{< fragment >}}
**Please! Let God save you this very moment.**
{{< /fragment >}}

---

{{< slide transition="slide-in fade-out" >}}

God's power will save you, keep you saved, and enable you to live a victorious Christian life. 

{{< fragment >}}
<span class="redtext">"There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, Who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it"</span> (I Corinthians 10:13).
{{< /fragment >}}

---

{{< slide transition="zoom-in slide-out"  >}}
**Do not trust your feelings. They change. Stand on God's promises. They never change.** 

---

After you are saved, there are three things to practice daily for spiritual growth: 

<ul>
{{< fragment >}}<li><b>Pray</b>—you talk to God.</li>{{< /fragment >}}
{{< fragment >}}<li><b>Read your Bible</b>—God talks to you.</li>{{< /fragment >}}
{{< fragment >}}<li><b>Witness</b>—you talk for God.</li>{{< /fragment >}}
</ul>

---

You should be baptized in obedience to the Lord Jesus Christ as a public testimony of your salvation, and then unite with a Bible-believing church without delay. 

{{< fragment >}}
<span class="redtext">"Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord..."</span> (2 Timothy 1:8).
{{< /fragment >}}

---

<span class="redtext">"Whosoever therefore shall confess</span> [testify of] <span class="redtext">Me before men, him will I confess also before My Father which is in heaven"</span> (Matthew 10:32).
