{{< slide transition="slide-in fade-out" transition-speed="fast"  >}}


Long ago in the days of King Saul of Israel, a boy named David helped his
seven brothers look after their father's flocks.

Though he was youngest, David was a strong, brave boy who loved anbd trusted God. He lived in the town of Bethlehem.

Once a lion attacked the flock to snatch a little lamb for supper. <br/>Young David attacked the attacker.

Pulling the lamb away, he grabbed the snarling beast by its beard and killed it. David knew God had helped him.

Samuel, God's prophet, was still sad that King Saul had failed God so badly. "How long will you mourn for Saul", God scolded Samuel. "I am sending you Jesse ... For I have 
provided Myself a king among his sons." Jesse was David's father.

Even though Samuel knew King Saul might kill him for going to find another king,
the prophet obeyed God.

When Samuel arrived, Jesse mad seven of his sons pass before Samuel. 
And Samuel said to Jesse, "The LORD has not chosen these." 
That only left David, the youngest. He was out with the sheep. They brought David in.
And the LORD said, "Arise, anoint him; for this is the one."

In Saul's palace, the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul and he became a very troubled man. His servants thought good music might settle Saul's mind. One of them knew a young man who played the harp well. Can you guess who that man was? Yes, David.

---

David's music soothed Saul and helped him to think straight. 
Saul asked Jesse to let David stay in the King's service. 
Whenever Saul had an attack of depression or fear, David played the harp for him. It helped.

---

After David went home, Saul had a big battle with the Philistines. 
David's brothers fought in Saul's armies. Jesse sent David to the battle front to take food to his brothers and find out how they were.

---

A HUGE Philistine giant, Goliath, had scared all the Israelite soldiers.

---


"Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me!" Goliath shouted. "If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us."

All the men of Israel, when they saw the giant, fled from him and were dreadfully afraid.

---

Then David said to Saul, "Let no man's heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine." Saul wanted David to wear armor and carry a sword. Instead, David took his sling and picked five smooth stones from the brook.


---

Goliath laughed when he was that young David wasn't even wearing armor. "I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field!" he roared. 

"I come to you in the name of the LORD!" David answered. "This day the LORD will deliver you into my hands ... for the battle is the LORD's!"

---

Then David ran straight toward Goliath. As he ran, he fired one stone from his sling - right into Goliath's forehead.

Goliath fell.

---

David quickly drew Goliath's huge sword and cut off his head.

When the Philistines saw Goliath dead, they ran for their lives.

The End
