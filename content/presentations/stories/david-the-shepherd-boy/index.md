seven brothers look after their father's flocks.

Pulling the lamb away, he grabbed the snarling beast by its beard and killed it. David knew God had helped him.

Samuel, God's prophet, was still sad that King Saul had failed God so badly. "How long will you mourn for Saul", God scolded Samuel. "I am sending you Jesse ... For I have 
provided Myself a king among his sons." Jesse was David's father.

---

Even though Samuel knew King Saul might kill him for going to find another king,
the prophet obeyed God.

---

When Samuel arrived, Jesse mad seven of his sons pass before Samuel. 
And Samuel said to Jesse, "The LORD has not chosen these." 
That only left David, the youngest. He was out with the sheep. They brought David in.
And the LORD said, "Arise, anoint him; for this is the one."

---

In Saul's palace, the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul and he became a very troubled man. His servants thought good music might settle Saul's mind. One of them knew a young man who played the harp well. Can you guess who that man was? Yes, David.

---

David's music soothed Saul and helped him to think straight. 
Saul asked Jesse to let David stay in the King's service. 
Whenever Saul had an attack of depression or fear, David played the harp for him. It helped.

---

After David went home, Saul had a big battle with the Philistines. 
David's brothers fought in Saul's armies. Jesse sent David to the battle front to take food to his brothers and find out how they were.

---

A HUGE Philistine giant, Goliath, had scared all the Israelite soldiers.
