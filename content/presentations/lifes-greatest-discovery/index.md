# Life's Greatest Discovery.


---

{{< slide background="yellowgreen"  >}}

God had a plan when He designed the universe in which we live. He also had a plan when he designed you.
The most wonderful experience you can have is to discover and participate in God's plan for your life.


---

## First ...

{{< fragment >}}
Life's greatest discovery begins when you realize God loves you, and has a wonderful plan for your life. (A life with meaning and purpose now and in the life to come.)
{{< /fragment >}}

---

The Bible says, "God loves you."

{{< fragment >}}
*For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.* <br/>— John 3:16.
{{< /fragment >}}


---

God wants you to know His plan for your life.

{{< fragment >}}
*I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly (a life full of meaning and purpose)* — John 10:10b.
{{< /fragment >}}

---

From the Bible you see that God loves you and wants you to enjoy the abundant life.

{{< fragment >}}
<span class="green">Why do you suppose most people are not experiencing God's love and enjoying an abundant life?</span>
{{< /fragment >}}

---

## Second ...

<span class="green">Because ...</span>

{{< fragment >}}

Man is a sinner and sin has separated him from God. God created man His image and gave him an abundant life. He did not make him as a puppet on a string to love and obey Him automatically; but gave him a will and freedom of choice.

{{< /fragment >}}

---

Man chose to disobey God and go his own self-willed, sinful way. Man is still making this choice today. Everyone of us, you and me included, has chosen to disobey God in many ways . . .

{{< fragment >}}
*Your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid His face from you . . .*  <br/>— Isaiah 59:2.
{{< /fragment >}}

---

The Bible says that there is not one perfect man.

{{< fragment >}}
*For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not* — Ecclesiastes 7:20.
{{< /fragment >}}

<p></p>

{{< fragment >}}
*For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God* <br/>— Romans 3:23.
{{< /fragment >}}

---

Sin is missing the mark of perfection, a falling short of God's plan for your life and results in spiritual death.

{{< fragment >}}
*For the wages of sin is death (separation from God in Hell)* — Romans 6:23.
{{< /fragment >}}

---

Man through the ages has tried to bridge the gap which separates himself from God by doing good works ... living moral lives ... devising profound philosophies ... even being religious. But he has always failed.

---

<p>
{{< fragment >}}
**There is only one remedy for the problem of sin and separation.**
{{< /fragment >}}
</p>

---

## THIRD ...

{{< fragment >}}
God's remedy for sin is Jesus Christ crucified.
{{< /fragment >}}

---


When Jesus died on the cross. He paid for our sins and bridged the gap that separates us from God.

{{< fragment >}}
*For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God* — I Peter 3:18a.
{{< /fragment >}}

<p></p>

{{< fragment >}}
*Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved* — Acts 4:12.
{{< /fragment >}}

---

{{< slide background="yellowgreen"  >}}

The Bible says that Jesus died a humiliating, agonizing death. His death paid the penalty for all our sins. But He didn't stay dead. He rose again that we might be right with God. The gap created by our sin has been bridged by Jesus' death and resurrection.

---

{{< slide background="yellowgreen"  >}}

**He died for our sins.**

{{< fragment >}}
*But God commendeth (proved) His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us* — Romans 5:8.
{{< /fragment >}}

---

{{< slide background="yellowgreen"  >}}

**He rose from the dead.**

{{< fragment >}}
*That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved* — Romans 10:9.
{{< /fragment >}}

---

{{< slide background="yellowgreen"  >}}

**Jesus Christ is the only way to God.**

{{< fragment >}}
*Jesus said unto him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me"* — John 14:6.
{{< /fragment >}}

---

{{< slide background="yellowgreen"  >}}

It is not enough to discover that God loves you and has a plan for your life ... that man is a sinner ... and Christ is God's remedy for sin . . .

---

## FOURTH ...

{{< fragment >}}
You must receive Christ as your personal Lord and Saviour.
{{< /fragment >}}

---

It is your decision.

Receiving Christ involves turning over control of your life to Christ.

---

### WHO CONTROLS YOUR LIFE?

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jereme/image/upload/v1751713767/gospelslides/lifes-greatest-discovery/04-who-controls-your-life.jpg" alt="Who controls your life?">

<p></p>
{{< fragment >}}
**On which side are you? <br/>
On which side would you like to be?**
{{< /fragment >}}

---

<span class="green">Here's how you can personally receive Christ.</span>

{{< fragment >}}
Trust Jesus and receive Him by personal invitation.
{{< /fragment >}}

<p></p>
{{< fragment >}}
*But as many as received Him, to him gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name* — John 1:12.
{{< /fragment >}}

<p></p>
{{< fragment >}}
*For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved* — Romans 10:13.
{{< /fragment >}}

<p></p>
{{< fragment >}}
*Behold I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear My voice, and open the door I will come in to him* — Revelation 3:20.
{{< /fragment >}}

---

Jesus is seeking entrance into your life at this moment.
Is there any good reason why you cannot receive Jesus Christ right now?


---

{{< slide transition="slide-in fade-out" transition-speed="fast"  >}}

<span class="green">It's really very simple, much like taking ...</span>

---

{{< slide transition="fade-in slide-out" transition-speed="fast" >}}

## FOUR STEPS

<ul>
{{< fragment >}}<li><span class="green">Step One</span> — Admit that you are a sinner and that your sin has separated you from God.</li>{{< /fragment >}}
{{< fragment >}}<li><span class="green">Step Two</span> — Repent (turn away from your sin and toward God) and ask Him to forgive you.</li>{{< /fragment >}}
{{< fragment >}}<li><span class="green">Step Three</span> — Trust in Jesus who died to pay for your sin and rose victorious over death, giving proof that He is God.</li>{{< /fragment >}}
{{< fragment >}}<li><span class="green">Step Four</span> — Yield/commit your life to Him to take control of, from this moment on.</li>{{< /fragment >}}
</ul>

---

Trusting in Jesus is more than mentally recognizing Him as the Son of God or having an emotional experience. You must receive Him as your personal Lord and Savior.

---

{{< slide background="yellowgreen"  >}}

You can express these steps to God by talking to Him in prayer. His main concern is that you understand what you are doing and that you are praying from your heart.

---

{{< slide background="yellowgreen"  >}}

The following is a suggested prayer:

Dear God, I come to you as a sinner. I realize that I deserve to go to hell but am asking that you would be merciful to me and forgive me of my sin. I commit my life to You to take full control of, from this day forward. Thank you for the gift of salvation as I now place my faith and trust in Jesus as my personal Lord and Savior. In Jesus name I pray, Amen.

---

{{< slide background="yellowgreen"  >}}

Does this prayer express the desire of your heart? Right now you can pray this prayer and claim the promise that God has made to you and to all that will receive by faith the gift of God which is eternal life in Jesus Christ our Lord.

Please call the church office (829-1127) if you have prayed this prayer so we can rejoice with you and hopefully help you to grow spiritually in your new life of faith in Christ.

---

Here's how to
## KNOW 

{{< fragment >}}
<span class="green">Jesus Christ is in your life!</span>
{{< /fragment >}}

---

Did you invite Christ into your life?

According to Revelation 3:20, where is Christ right now?
<p></p>
{{< fragment >}}

What does Romans 10:13 say God will do when a person prays and invites Christ into their life?

{{< /fragment >}}
<p></p>
{{< fragment >}}

Would God lie to you?

{{< /fragment >}}

---

Eternal life is promised in the Bible to all who receive Christ as personal Saviour.

{{< fragment >}}
*And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and He that hath not the Son of God hath not life.
These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God* — I John 5:11-13.
{{< /fragment >}}

---

Eternal life is a gift and cannot be earned. It is a part of God's wonderful plan for your life.

---


{{< slide background="yellowgreen"  >}}

<span class="green">Many people wonder about feelings.</span>

## FEELINGS CHANGE ...

{{< fragment >}}
but God and His Word will never change. We are to live by faith, (trusting in the promises of God found in the Bible). For without faith, it is impossible to please God.
{{< /fragment >}}

---

Will you live your life by feelings (which constantly change) or by faith in God and His Word which cannot change?

---

**Many wonderful things happened when you receive Christ. Here are a few:**

<ol>
  {{< fragment >}}<li>Christ came into your life. Revelation 3:20 ... I will come in to him.</li>{{< /fragment >}}
  {{< fragment >}}<li>You became a child of God. John 1:12 ... Power to become the Sons of God.</li>{{< /fragment >}}
  {{< fragment >}}<li>Your sins were forgiven. Colossians 1:14 ... The forgiveness of sins.</li>{{< /fragment >}}
  {{< fragment >}}<li>You have eternal life. Romans 6:23 ... The gift of God is eternal life.</li>{{< /fragment >}}
</ol>

---

Nothing more wonderful could happen to you than receiving Christ.

{{< fragment >}}
It would please God for you to thank Him through prayer right now for what He has done for you. This prayer of thanksgiving demonstrates your love for God.
{{< /fragment >}}

<span class="green">What's next?</span>
{{< /fragment >}}

---


<span class="green">As a newborn baby has a lifetime of learning and growth ahead of him ... so you, a new child of God, have an exciting life of spiritual growth ahead of you. </span>

---

{{< slide transition="slide-in fade-out" transition-speed="fast" >}}

<span class="green">Here are some ways you can grow spiritually:</span>
<ol>
  {{< fragment >}}<li>Tell someone what you have done, then continue telling others about Christ. (Acts 1:8)</li>{{< /fragment >}}
  {{< fragment >}}<li>Be baptized. Baptism is the immersion in water of a believer in Christ. (Acts 8:35-40)</li>{{< /fragment >}}
  {{< fragment >}}<li>Read your Bible. (II Timothy 2:15). You need to study your Bible daily to become aware of what God wants to do for you and through you.</li>{{< /fragment >}}
</ol>

---

{{< slide transition="fade-in slide-out" transition-speed="fast" >}}

<ol start="4">
  <li>Talk to God often in prayer. Share with Him your joys, sorrows, needs ... your whole life. (Philippians 4:6-7)</li>
  {{< fragment >}}<li>Come to church regularly and share in the growth, worship and fellowship. (Hebrews 10:25)</li>{{< /fragment >}}
</ol>

---

<span class="green">Here's what the Bible teaches about Baptism!</span>

---

### Why?

Because ...

<ol>
  {{< fragment >}}<li>God commands it. (Matthew 28:19-20)</li>{{< /fragment >}}
  {{< fragment >}}<li>Jesus was baptized. (Mark 1:9-11)</li>{{< /fragment >}}
  {{< fragment >}}<li>Baptism illustrates our salvation (I Corinthians 15:1-4; Romans 6:3-5)</li>{{< /fragment >}}
</ol>

---

### How?

By Immersion in Water, <br/>because ...

  1. Jesus was immersed.
  (Matthew 3:13-17; Mark 1:9-11)
  2. The Greek work baptizo means immersion.
  3. The early church immersed.
  (Acts 2:41; 8:35-39)

---

### When?

1. After Conversion. (Acts 8:35-39)
2. At your first opportunity. (Acts 8:36; 16:25-34)

You can see from the Bible the why, how, and when of baptism. This is part of God's plan for you and you should follow Christ in believer's baptism as soon as possible.

---

Here is what the Bible teaches about ...
## the Church!

---

The Bible commands us to attend church regularly. (Hebrews 10:25). You need to meet with others who have trusted the Lord Jesus Christ and be taught from the Bible. You need the church for several reasons: worship, teaching, fellowship, counsel.

Several logs burn brightly together, but put one aside on the cold hearth and the fire goes out. 



---
So it is with your relationship to other Christians. You need to belong to a Bible-believing church. Do not wait to be invited. Take the initiative; call the pastor of a nearby church where Christ is honored and His Word is preached. Start this week, and make plans to attend regularly.
