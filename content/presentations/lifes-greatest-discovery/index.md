# Life's Greatest Discovery.


---

{{< slide background="greenyellow"  >}}

God had a plan when He designed the universe in which we live. He alos had a plan when he designed you.
The most wonderful experience you can have is to discover and participate in God's plan for your life.

## First ...

{{< fragment >}}
Life's greatest discovery begins when you realize God loves you, and has a wonderful plan for your life. (A life with meaning and purpose now and in the life to come.)
{{< /fragment >}}

The Bible says, "God loves you."
>For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. <br/>— John 3:16.


---

God wants you to know His plan for your life.
I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly (a life full of meaning and purpose) — John 10:10b.

---

From the Bible you see that God loves you and wants you to enjoy the abundant life.

Why do you suppose most people are not experiencing God's love and enjoying an abundant life?

## Second ...

<span class="green">Because . . .</span>

Man is a sinner and sin has separated him from God. God created man His image and gave him an abundant life. He did not make him as a puppet on a string to love and obey Him automatically; but gave him a will and freedom of choice.

Man chose to disobey God and go his own self-willed, sinful way. Man is still making this choice today. Everyone of us, you and me included, has chosen to disobey God in many ways . . .

>Your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid His face from you . . .  <br/>— Isaiah 59:2.

The Bible says that there is not one perfect man.
For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not — Ecclesiastes 7:20.
For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God — Romans 3:23.

---

Sin is missing the mark of perfection, a falling short of God's plan for your life and results in spiritual death.
For the wages of sin is death (separation from God in Hell) — Romans 6:23.

---

Man through the ages has tried to bridge the gap which separates himself from God by doing good works . . . living moral lives . . . devising profound philosophies . . . even being religious. But he has always failed.
